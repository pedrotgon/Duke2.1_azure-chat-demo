## Extending LLMs with Microservices

This example uses an external HTTP API with a native Python function to extend
its functionality.

To work with this example, it will require to [clone the microservice
repository](https://github.com/alfredodeza/historical-temperatures) and follow
the instructions to install the dependencies and start the service _before_
running this example.
